<p>The Mid-Atlantic Vipassana Association (MAVA) was formed in 2005 with the goal of establishing a Vipassana Meditation Center in the Mid-Atlantic region.  </p> 

<p>
Every year MAVA had been offering four 10 day Vipassana Meditation courses at non-center locations. In 2012, MAVA conducted five 10 day courses at non-center locations. These courses were always oversubscribed with long waiting lists. This alone indicated a great need for a permanent Vipassana center where ongoing courses could be offered in the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>

<p>Therefore, MAVA acquired a property on 10th October, 2013 in Claymont, Delaware, to establish a Mid-Atlantic Vipassana Meditation Center.</p>
 
 <p>
The property was purchased for $700,000 with $300,000 in student donations, $100,000 in seller refinancing and a $300,000 old student loan. The 13.8 acres campus has 4 large buildings and 1 maintenance building with a total of 25,000 sq. ft. </p> 

<p>
Mr. S. N. Goenka, the principal teacher of Vipassana Meditation, gave his blessings and named the center as “Dhamma Pubbananda” - the joy of the east. He also called it "Dhamma Delaware”. </p>

<p>In November 2014, as part of Phase I expansion, building 1 was completely renovated and MAVA started holding 19 person, single gender, 10-day and 3-day courses. Once completed, this new center became a beacon of Dhamma in the region.</p>

<p> 
In December 2016 Phase II expansion, building 2 - the dining complex was completed with a brand new commercial kitchen, two new dining halls and new dormitories. The inauguration celebration of the new building took place on December 31st, 2016 where 80+ old students gathered to celebrate and participate with joy the expansion of this urban center. This expansion has increased the total capacity from 19 to 72 (60 students and 12 servers). The first dual gender course was held on January 4th, 2017.
</p>
<p>
Planning for Phase III expansion has started which will be a complete renovation of Building 3. This plan is expected to include the creation of 30 single rooms with attached bathrooms and 22 meditation cells.
</p>
<p>
The pre-construction work, planning and construction has already started . The completion of this phase will depend on the availability of needed funds..</p>
