<h3>Arrival time</h3>

<p><b>Please arrive between 2:00 and 4:00 pm. on the day the course begins.</b></p>
<p>This allows time for you to check in, get your accommodation and unpack. Late arrivals make it difficult for the staff to serve everyone efficiently and to start the course on time. If you have an emergency and are unable to arrive at the requested time, please notify us as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A light meal will be served at 6:00 pm. followed by a pre-course orientation.</p>

<h3>Departure time</h3>

<p><strong>Please make your return travel plans before arriving at the center, as you will not have access to your cell phone until after the course is completed.</strong></p>
<p>You are expected to stay until the course is completed at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the last day of the course. Although the course ends at 7:00 a.m., please allow enough time to clean your room before you leave. We rely on students to prepare the center for the next course.</p>
<p>When making travel arrangements, please allow sufficient time for travel to and from the center. For example, if you are flying out of Bradley International airport, all return flights should be booked no earlier than 11:00am. This will allow you enough time to clean your accommodation and arrive at the airport at a reasonable time.</p>
<p>After being accepted into a course, if your plans change in any way, please notify us immediately.</p>
