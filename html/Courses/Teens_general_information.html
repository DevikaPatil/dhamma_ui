        <p class="wp-caption-text">Teen's Meditation</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our meditation courses for teenagers. These courses are for young people aged 12 to 15, and have been designed specifically for this age group. You will learn Anapana meditation, with guided instructions for periods of up to one hour. Throughout the day there will also be journal writing, rest periods and service activities. During the course you will be asked to not speak with the other students except at meal times.</p>

<p>Please read all of the information carefully. On these pages you will find links to two sample schedules, the Code of Conduct (which will explain how we all need to behave while at the center), and an application form which you must print and fill out.</p>
<p>Please ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) to complete the permission and medical emergency forms and return these with your application. After we receive your completed forms, we will contact you.</p>
