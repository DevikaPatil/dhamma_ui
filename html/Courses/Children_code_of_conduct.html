    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
Learning to practice Anapana meditation is very valuable because it helps you to become a better person. Practicing Anapana meditation will help you to train your mind to become concentrated and calm. This will make your mind strong so that you will be able to avoid doing or saying things that are hurtful or harmful to yourself and to others. This strength of mind will help you to feel happier and more peaceful. Practicing Anapana and learning to concentrate will help you to become the master of your mind.
</p>

<p>
To help you succeed in practicing Anapana meditation it is important that you do your best to follow the instructions that you will be given during the course. While you are at the course, it is also important that you agree to follow the Code of Conduct written below. In the same way that a house needs a good foundation to support it, so the practice of Anapana needs a good foundation. This good foundation for Anapana is built by following the Code of Conduct. It will help you to avoid performing actions that are harmful or hurtful to yourself and others.
</p>

<p>
During the first meditation session at the course you will be asked to repeat the following five vows or precepts. These are written in bold and underneath each is an explanation. Please read them carefully so that you will understand what you are saying when the time comes:
</p>

<p>
<b>I shall abstain from killing.</b>
</p>
<p>
 I promise to try to treat all beings kindly and not kill them or harm them in any way.
</p>
<p><b>
I shall abstain from stealing.</b></p>
 <p>I promise to take only what is given to me and not take anything which belongs to others without permission.
</p>
<p><b>
I shall abstain from a misconduct life.</b></p>
<p>
 I promise to treat other boys and girls as if they were my brothers or sisters or best friends. I promise not to indulge in any sexual activity.
</p>
<p><b>
I shall abstain from speaking lies, harsh words, backbiting, etc. which will harm others.</b></p>
<p>
 I promise to speak truthfully, kindly and gently, and not to tell lies or to say hurtful things to anybody or about anybody.
</p>
<p><b>
I shall abstain from taking any intoxicant.</b></p>
<p>
 I promise not to take any alcohol, drugs or intoxicants, but to keep my mind clear.
</p>
<p>
At the bottom of your application form you will find a question that asks if you agree to try to follow this Code of Conduct while you are at the one-day meditation course site.
