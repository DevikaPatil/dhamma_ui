<p>The Child and Teen Courses offer young people an introduction to Anapana
meditation. Anapana is the practice of observing the natural breath to concentrate
the mind. It is the first step to Vipassana meditation, a universal and non-sectarian
technique.</p>
<p>Young people who have started practicing Anapana have realized many benefits.
Their ability to concentrate becomes enhanced, their memory gets sharper, their
ability to comprehend a subject improves and they become calmer. In general, they
feel they have a practical tool to use in the face of many types of adversity or
challenge.</p>
<p>In the words of some children who have completed similar meditation courses at
other Vipassana centers around the world:
<ul class="list-style">
<li>&quot;I learned that I like meditating because it makes me feel relaxed.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I like this course because I like playing outside, playing with clay. We also
did tie-dye. I also like this course because it seems like I am at home and the
food is so good&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;At school if I need to concentrate on what the teacher is doing or saying I
can use Anapana. And if I am mad and angry I can use Anapana.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I think meditation is very important in this busy world because it helps us to
maintain a stable state of our mind and also it helps us to do our work with
right understanding.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>During the course there will be meditation sessions with instructions, stories and
discussion for up to 30 minutes. In between, are break periods, meals and activities.
(See the <a class="link-navbar" href="/html/Courses/Children_sample_schedule.html">Sample Schedules</a>.)</p>
<p>The students will be grouped by age and assigned group leaders who will personally
accompany and assist them throughout the course, providing support and guidance
as needed.</p>
