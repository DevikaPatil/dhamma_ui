    <h2 class="page-title">Course Checklist</h2>



<ul class="list-style">
 <li> I have double checked course dates. A ten day course actually spans 12 days in total. Please double check your course finish date and make plans accordingly. </li>
 <li> I know how to get to the centre.  For directions see <a class="link-navbar" href="/html/Center/Direction_and_travel.html">Directions & Travel</a></li>
 <li> I have the center&rsquo;s phone number for bus pickup/emergencies : [1]202-556-3882 (202-55-METTA)</li>
 <li> I have packed everything I need.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What to bring</h2>

<h3>Required Items (Not Provided)</h3>


<ul class="list-style">
 <li> Alarm Clock, flashlight, and batteries for both. (You may not use your cell phone or other personal electronic device as an alarm clock) </li>
 <li> Top and bottom sheet and pillowcase for a twin-size bed. </li>
 <li> Enough comfortable, loose fitting, modest, somewhat baggy clothing for the duration of your stay: pants or skirts that cover your knees when you are meditating (when sitting either on a chair or on the floor), T-shirts without distracting images and words. If you have tattoos, please bring clothing to cover them so they do not distract others. These guidelines allow other students to focus on their meditation more easily. </li>
 <li> Towel and all needed toiletries, non-scented personal hygiene articles and feminine sanitary protection.</li>
 <li> Water Bottle.</li>
 <li> Any prescribed medication you are taking. Please make sure you bring enough for the entire course.</li>
