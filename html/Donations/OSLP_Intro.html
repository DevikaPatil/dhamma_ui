<h2>Introduction to the Old Student Loan Program</h2>
<p>The Mid-Atlantic Vipassana Association (MAVA) is working to increase the student capacity at
Dhamma Delaware from a 15 person to 80+ person capacity running 10-day Vipassana courses
throughout the year. For details of the growth plan and construction phases, see the old student
website.</p>

<p>The Old Student Loan Program (OSLP) we have developed is based on other programs currently in
operation at other centers. This program will help us with funding towards the growth of the center.</p>

<p>* While these are standard programs offered, please note that if old student has the volition and
ability; or chooses to donate interest back, a much simpler loan at fixed interest rate of 1.5% can be
constructed. Please also note that longer duration loans (15 years) allow more funds to be directed
to construction activities.
</p>
<p>
Exceptions to the schedule above may be made based on specific individual circumstances for loan
amounts $100k or greater and with mutual agreement between old student and the finance
committee.
</p>
<p>
We invite you to examine the attached outline on the Old Student Loan Program (OSLP). Refer to
FAQs and Loan Offer agreement.
</p>
<p>
We would like to implement the OSLP by accepting loan amounts convenient for students, and
structuring the repayment of the principal amount in a way to provide maximum assurance of
repayment ability. Interest offered is designed to encourage longer loan terms by offsetting the
chance of rising interest rate returns in the commercial markets.
</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact us for more information and details of this program.
