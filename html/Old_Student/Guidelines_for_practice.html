    <h2 class="page-title">Guidelines for practicing Vipassana meditation</h2>
	
<p>A Vipassana course is truly valuable only if it makes a change in your life, and a change will come only if you keep practicing the technique on a daily basis. The following outline of what you have learned is offered with best wishes for your continued success in meditation.</p>
<h3>Sila</h3>
<p>In daily life this is practiced by following the Five Precepts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="m5">to abstain from killing any being</li>
<li class="m5">to abstain from stealing</li>
<li class="m5">to abstain from sexual misconduct</li>
<li class="m5">to abstain from wrong speech</li>
<li class="m5">to abstain from all intoxicants</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meditation</h3>
<p>The minimum needed to maintain the practice:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li class="m5">one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening</li>
<li class="m5">five minutes while lying in bed before you fall asleep and after you wake up</li>
<li class="m5">if possible, sitting once a week for one hour with other meditators practicing this technique of Vipassana</li>
<li class="m5">a ten-day course or self-course once a year</li>
<li class="m5">and other free time for meditation</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to meditate in daily practice:</h3>
<h3>Anapana</h3>
<p>Practice this if the mind is dull or agitated, if it is difficult to feel sensations or difficult not to react to them. You can begin with Anapana and then switch to Vipassana or, if needed, continue observing the breath for the entire hour. To practice Anapana, keep the attention in the area below the nostrils and above the upper lip. Remain aware of each breath as it enters or leaves. If the mind is very dull or very agitated, breathe deliberately and slightly harder for some time. Otherwise, the breathing should be natural.</p>
<h3>Vipassana</h3>
<p>Move your attention systematically from head to feet and from feet to head, observing in order each and every part of the body by feeling all the sensations that you come across. Observe objectively; that is, remain equanimous with all the sensations that you experience, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, by appreciating their impermanent nature. Keep your attention moving. Never stay for more than a few minutes at any one place. Do not allow the practice to become mechanical. Work in different ways according to the type of sensations you experience. Areas of the body having different gross sensations should be observed separately by moving the attention part by part. Symmetrical parts, such as both arms or both legs, having similar subtle sensations, may be observed together simultaneously. If you experience subtle sensations throughout the physical structure, you may at times sweep the entire body and then again work part by part.</p>
<h3>Metta</h3>
<p>At the end of the hour relax, letting any mental or physical agitation subside. Then focus your attention for a few minutes on subtle sensations in the body, and fill your mind and body with thoughts and feelings of goodwill for all beings.</p>
<h3>Outside of Meditation periods</h3>
<p>Give your full and undivided attention to any important tasks before you, but check from time to time whether you are maintaining your awareness and equanimity. Whenever a problem arises, if possible be aware of your breath or sensations, even for a few seconds. This will help you to remain balanced in various situations.</p>
<h3>Dana</h3>
<p>Share whatever good you have acquired with others. Doing so helps to eradicate the old habit of self-centredness. Meditators realize that the most valuable thing they have to share is Dhamma. Not being able to teach, they do what they can to help others learn the technique. With this pure volition they donate toward the expenses of other students.</p>
<p>This dana is the sole source of funding for courses and centres around the world.</p>
<h3>Selfless Service</h3>
<p>A still greater dana is to give of one&#8217;s time and effort by helping to organize or run courses or by doing other Dhamma work. All who help (including the Teachers and Assistant Teachers) give their service as dana without receiving anything in return. This service not only benefits others, but also helps those offering it to eradicate egotism, to understand the teaching more deeply, and thus to advance on the path.</p>
<h3>One Path Only</h3>
<p>Do not mix this technique with others. If you have been practicing something else, you may attend two or three Vipassana courses to help you decide which technique you prefer. Then choose the one you find most suitable and beneficial, and devote yourself to it.</p>
<h3>Telling others about Vipassana</h3>
<p>You may describe the technique to others, but do not teach them. Otherwise you might confuse rather than help them. Encourage people who want to meditate to join a course, where there is a properly trained guide.</p>
<h3>In General</h3>
<p>Progress comes gradually. Mistakes are bound to be made â€” learn from them. When you realize you have made an error, smile and start again!</p>
<p>It is common to experience drowsiness, agitation, mind-wandering and other difficulties in meditation, but if you persevere you will be successful. You are welcome to contact the Teachers or Assistant Teachers for guidance. Make use of the support of your fellow meditators. Sitting with them will give you strength.</p>
<p>Make use of the meditative atmosphere at centres or Dhamma houses by going there to sit whenever you can, even for a few days or hours. As an old student you are also welcome to come for part of a ten-day course, depending on the availability of space, and assuming you have been practicing this technique of Vipassana only.</p>
<p>Real wisdom is recognizing and accepting that every experience is impermanent. With this insight you will not be overwhelmed by ups and downs. And when you are able to maintain an inner balance, you can choose to act in ways that will create happiness for you and for others. Living each moment happily with an equanimous mind, you will surely progress toward the ultimate goal of liberation from all suffering.</p>
