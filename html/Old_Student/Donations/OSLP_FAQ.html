<h2>Old Student Loan  Program: Frequently  Asked Questions </h2>

<strong>For Amount  caps, Term  etc please  see ‘Introduction to  OSLP</strong>

<p>If  an  Old Student,  wishes  to  donate  the interest  back  to  MAVA, it  can be  done. However,  interest  earned  is  reported  to  IRS on  Form  1099-INT  for both  interest  bearing and non-interest  bearing loans.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Why does  MAVA  need  loans from  Old Students? </strong></p>
<p>A:  The OSL Program has been  developed to  help  generate  the funding needed  for the growth  of  permanent center  in  the region. This  is  in  addition  to  dana  and monthly pledges. </p>   

<p><strong>Q:  Is  there a cost  to  the center  associated  with  issuing legal notes?</strong></p>
 <p>A:  No  fees  are anticipated.  No  lending institutions  are involved. The program documents are based on  other OSL programs  currently operating at  other centers.  If  enforcement action  were  to  become  necessary,  then  fees  would apply.  </p>  

<p><strong>Q:  How will  this  information be  communicated  to  Old Students? </strong></p>
<p>A:  Postings  on  weekly  sitting listserv. Posters at  the dana  table on  Days  10  and 11  following courses.  Old Student Loan  information will  be  part  of  the Day 10  talk. Forms will  be  at  Dana  table.  Webinars  will  be  held. Education and awareness of  need  among old students  by  e-mail, telephone or  personal  contacts. If  the student has the volition  they  may choose  to  take  action. </p>  

<p><strong>Q:  What  about student emergency situations?</strong></p> 
<p>A:  All attempts  will  be  made  to  keep  a back  up  fund/source at  all times,  in  the case  of  unforeseen  circumstances – such  as  settling  an  estate. </p>  

<p><strong>Q:  How is  the privacy and security  of  funds maintained?</strong></p> 
<p>A:  All information will  be  strictly  confidential  between the Center  and the Old Student lender. Only  a few individuals at  the Center, such  as  the Treasurer,  Loan  administrator,  and book  keeper  will  have  the loan  details.  An  identification  numbering system  will  be  used  instead of  names for record  keeping.  Trust members will  be  informed  of  totals, but not details of  names,  amounts and terms. </p>   

<p><strong>Q:  What  are the contingencies for early withdrawals?</strong></p>  
<p>A:  No  assurance to  withdraw  early.  However,  in  an  emergency,  every attempt would be  made  to  fulfill the obligation  in  a timely  manner.</p>   

<p><strong>Q:  How will  loans be  repaid?</strong></p> 
<p>A:  As  this  is  an  ongoing program,  short term  loans will  be  revolving regularly.  Monthly pledges and other dana  will  be  used  to  repay the loan  principal over  time.   Debt  service on  Long  term  loans will  be  paid  with  monthly pledges and other course  dana. </p>  

<p><strong>Q:  If  a personal  bank  loan  is  used  to  make  an  OSL offer,  will  the cost  be  covered?</strong></p>  
<p>A:  Yes,  MAVA  will  cover the cost  of  the loan  up  to  an  interest  rate  of  5%, if  the loan  offer is  accepted.</p>   

<p><strong>Q:  What  if  interest  rates go  up?</strong></p> 
<p>A:  Short term  loans are at  fixed interest  due to  the shorter duration.   Long  term  loans are pegged  to  prime to  accommodate changing  interest  climate.    A floor and ceiling are established to  ensure  minimum return  for old student and manage  risk  for the center. </p>  

<p><strong>Q:  What  if  loans are not needed  eventually?</strong></p> 
<p>A:  A loan  offer may not be  accepted  if  it  does  not fit in  the loan  portfolio.  For example:  3-year  portfolio,  4-year  portfolio,  5-year  portfolio;  all loans cannot  mature  at  the same  time. </p>  

<p><strong>Q:  When  will  the loans start earning interest?</strong></p> 
<p>A:  Effective date  for start of  the loan  will  be  when  the money is  used  for the Center. </p>
