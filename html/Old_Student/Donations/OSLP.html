<h3>Old Student Loan Program</h3>
      
<p>It is so inspirational to see the role of MAVA region in facilitating the spread of Dhamma. Our ability to offer courses throughout the year has been possible because of the Regional Meditation Center at Delaware - Dhamma Pubbananda. 
</p>

<p>With the completion of Phase II expansion, the Center can accommodate 60 students and 12 servers allowing dual gender courses to be offered throughout the year.  However, Goenkaji has said that an ideal meditation center should have individual rooms and cells available for each student to meditate in. Keeping this in mind and seeing the successful execution of Phase II expansion (under budget and on schedule), the MAVA Trust has given a go ahead to start developing plans for Phase III expansion.  
</p>

<p>
Phase III will focus on providing a better and more conducive environment for students to meditate and deepen their practice.  Our goal is to: <br>

•	provide single rooms with attached bathrooms and <br> 
•	individual cells for students to meditate in. 

</p>

  <p>
  In order to facilitate this expansion, the finance committee is complimenting the current dana stream with a very attractive Long Term Old Student Loan Program (OSLP) that will be beneficial to the old students as well as the Center.  This loan program offers interest rates that can go up to 5.5%... If you are interested in learning more about this program, please click on the documents below.

<h3> Personal Guarantee</h3>
<p>
A Personal Guarantee is a guarantee in which an Old Student agrees to be responsible for the financial obligations of MAVA to a lender related to loan, in the event that MAVA fails to pay an amount owed under the loan agreement. This commitment is guarantee for a future event and as such no money is given to MAVA at the time of giving this personal guarantee. Old Student potential future liability is limited to the personal guarantee amount that is offered. </p>
