   	 <h2>Old Student Loan Program</h2>
    
	<p>It is so inspirational to see the role of MAVA region in facilitating the spread of Dhamma.  Last year 256 students sat / served courses offered in the region.  In 2015 the number is expected to exceed 850 students. MAVA is now offering 20 10-Day courses and 8  3-Day courses. </p>

	<p>Our ability to offer courses throughout the year has been possible because of the Regional Meditation Center at Delaware. These courses are always over subscribed and some times the waitlist is three to four times the current center capacity.  The Center can currently accommodate 15 students of a single gender. Our goal is to offer dual gender courses at the Center with a student capacity of 40+ students by the end of 2016. </p>

	<p>In order to facilitate this expansion the finance committee is complimenting the current dana stream with a very attractive Long Term Old Student Loan Program (OSLP) that will be beneficial to the old students as well as the Center.  This loan program offers interest rates that can go up to 5.5%... If you are interested in learning more about this program, please click on the documents below.</p>
