    <h2>Old Student Courses</h2>
    
    <h3>Short courses</h3>
    
    <p>There are 1 day and 3 day courses are for any student who has completed a 10-day course with S. N. Goenka and 
    his assistant teachers. We encourage you to apply if it has been some time since your last course. 
    One day courses are from 9am â€“ 5pm, longer courses begin at 2-4 PM the first day and end by 7:30am or 5 PM the last day. 
    Please review the <a class="link-navbar" href="/html/Serving_Opportunity/Serving_code_of_conduct.html">Code of Discipline</a></p> 
    
	<h3>Satipatthana Sutta</h3>
	<p>Sattipatthana Sutta courses have the same timetable and discipline as 10-day course. 
	The difference is that in the taped evening discourses the Satipatthana Sutta is carefully examined. 
	This is the principal text in which the technique of Vipassana is systematically explained . 
	These courses are open to serious old students who have completed at least three 10-day courses, 
	have not been practicing any other meditation techniques since last 10-day course, 
	have been practicing this technique of Vipassana for at least one year, 
	and who are trying to maintain the five Precepts in their daily lives. 
	Please review the <a class="link-navbar" href="/html/Serving_Opportunity/Serving_code_of_conduct.html">Code of Discipline</a></p>
	
	<h3>Serve a Course</h3>
	<p>As an old student, you can now choose to serve on a course. 
	To serve a ten-day course is a very special kind of service. 
	We all find this an invaluable tool for strengthening our own practice as well as helping others get the Dhamma. 
	And for those of us with less time available, even serving a portion of a course is a wonderful experience. 
	Applications should be submitted ahead of time. 
	Servers work long hours, but always sit at least three hours a day during group sittings and can usually attend the discourse. 
	Rest is always taken between 1:00 and 2:30 pm. Instructions for cooking and all other tasks are very easy to follow.</p>
