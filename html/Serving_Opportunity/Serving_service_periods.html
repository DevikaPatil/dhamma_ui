<h2>2016 Winter Dhamma Service Period: December 18 &#8211; December 28</h2>
<p><a title="Spring Service Period" href="http://www.dhara.dhamma.org/os/dhamma-service/service-periods/schedule/">Daily Schedule for Dhamma Service Periods</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/schedules/schdhara" target="_blank">Click here to apply for upcoming  Service Periods.</a></p>
<p>The Dhamma Service Period has a relaxed schedule that includes three daily group sittings, work on seasonal projects, and various evening programs designed to both inform and inspire old students. This DSP program is for all old students who have sat at least one course with S. N. Goenka or one of his assistant teachers and who have not practiced another meditation technique since their last course. Any such old student is welcome to serve all, or part, of the program.</p>
<p>After more than 25 years, the Pagoda at Dhamma Dhara is nearly finished!  The two story cell complex which started in 1990 will soon be crowned with a golden pagoda (zedi in the Burmese language).  This pagoda was fabricated in Burma and is now being assembled at VMC.  During the DSP, skilled and unskilled servers are need to help with the cleaning, assembly, and erection of the Pagoda.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of work to be done this fall as we will be deep cleaning the interiors, doing some extensive gardening/landscaping and many more projects which cannot be done while courses are in progress; it&#8217;s an exciting time to be at the center!  In addition to the three daily group sittings there will also be evening programs and informational presentations. </p>
<p>Please apply if you have the time and volition to serve.  We hope to see you soon.</p>
<p>Please feel free to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:dhamma-service@dhara.dhamma.org">dhamma-service@dhara.dhamma.org</a> or call the center at: 413-625-2160 mailbox #3, if you have any questions.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you here!</p>
