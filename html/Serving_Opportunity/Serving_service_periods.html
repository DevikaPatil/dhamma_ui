<p>The Dhamma Service Period has a relaxed schedule that includes three daily group sittings, work on seasonal projects, 
and various evening programs designed to both inform and inspire old students. 
This DSP program is for all old students who have sat at least one course with S. N. Goenka or one of his assistant teachers 
and who have not practiced another meditation technique since their last course. 
Any such old student is welcome to serve all, or part, of the program.</p>

<p>The Center will soon enter the Phase III of Center development. This

phase will include the complete renovation of building 3. The building

is expected to provide a better and more conducive environment for

students to meditate in and deepen their practice. Students will have

their own private rooms with attached bathrooms to help reduce

distractions. Besides this there will be individual cells available for

students to meditate in. Goenkaji said that an ideal meditation center

should have individual rooms and cells available for each student to

meditate in. In phase III of center development, the cell structure will

include 22 cells in building 3. Another 22 cells will be added during

phase IV in building 4. The cell structures will be crowned with a

small golden pagoda (zedi in Burmese language). During the DSP

and phase III construction both skilled and unskilled servers are

needed to help with the cleanup, framing, assembly and erection of

the Pagoda.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of work to be done this year as we will be deep cleaning the interiors, doing some extensive gardening/landscaping and many more projects which cannot be done while courses are in progress; it&#8217;s an exciting time to be at the center!  In addition to the three daily group sittings there will also be evening programs and informational presentations. </p>
<p>Please apply if you have the time and volition to serve.  We hope to see you soon.</p>
<p>Please feel free to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:dhamma-service@delaware.dhamma.org">dhamma-service@delaware.dhamma.org</a> or call the center if you have any questions.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you here!</p>
