   <h2>Ways to Serve</h2>

<p><b>1. During Courses:</b> Serve a course full- or part-time.  To serve a ten-day course is a very special kind of service. We all find this an invaluable tool for strengthening our own practice as well as helping others get the Dhamma.  And for those of us with less time available, even serving a portion of a course is a wonderful experience. Applications should be submitted ahead of time.</p>

<p>Servers work long hours, but always sit at least three hours a day during group sittings and can usually attend the discourse.  Rest is always taken between 1:00 and 2:30 pm.  Instructions for menus and all other tasks are very easy to follow.</p>

<p>Please let us know in advance when you are coming to the center. To fill out a Dhamma-service application online, visit the <a href="http://www.dhamma.org/en-US/schedules/schdelaware">Dhamma Pubbananda (Delaware) Course Schedule page</a>. Click on the &#8220;apply&#8221; link next to the course dates to apply for a course.</p>

<p><b>2. Day help :</b> It is to prepare meals and keep the center clean and tidy is also always appreciated by servers.  When you arrive introduce yourself to one of the center managers, and they will get you oriented. Day help is most needed between 9:00 am and 1:00 pm. It is always recommended to sit for one hour before giving service.</p>

<p><b>3. <a href="Serving_between_courses.html">Between Courses</a>:</b> From Sunday morning until Wednesday afternoon there are usually some students staying on at the center preparing for the up-coming course, or working on site maintenance, grounds or other projects. All Old Students are welcome to participate. The daily program will include three group sittings with morning and afternoon work periods. On selected evenings, there will be tapes played of special discourses and talks that S.N. Goenka has given to Old Students. These short work periods represent a great opportunity for old students to give service by coming early a day or two before their course or staying on afterwards. Look for the between-course Service Period for the dates you would like to give service and contact the center

<p><b>4. <a href="Serving_service_periods.html">Dhamma Service Periods</a>:</b> In the spring and fall months every year Dhamma Pubbananda (Delaware) holds a work period. During this time no course is held; Dhamma servers work together on projects all around the center. The jobs vary from grounds and garden work, maintenance, cleaning, and putting up tents. Meals are provided, and cooks are needed to keep the workers well nourished.  The schedule includes three group sittings daily and evening discourses. An assistant teacher is also available to meet with students who may have questions about their practice.</p>

<p><b>5. Join a <a href="Serving_committes.html">Committee</a>:</b>  Local meditators, trustees and Assistant Teachers work together on different committees that do the work of running the center. You may have a skill or expertise that you can offer a committee, or you may want to attend a meeting to learn more. The committees are: On-site (Kitchen, Maintenance, Household, Grounds), Center Development (Site Planning/Building), Registration, Dhamma Service, Communications (/Inreach/Outreach), Children’s Courses and Technology</p>

<p><b>6. Adopt-a-Job: </b>You may sign up for a  "bite-size" task, if you have limited time. Some are occasional tasks (like sewing) or seasonal(like putting up tents) and others have to be done each course (like day 0 jobs). There is something for everyone.  If you are interested please contact the Dhamma Service Committee at <a href="mailto:dhamma-service@delaware.dhamma.org">dhamma-service@delaware.dhamma.org</a> or contact the center management at <a href="mailto:manager@delaware.dhamma.org">manager@delaware.dhamma.org</a> .</p>

<p><b>7. Come to a Trust Meeting:</b> Old students are appointed to the Board of Trustees.  This group works together to oversee the operation of the center and guide the committees. The Trust meets once a month according to the schedule at 9:15 am EST. All interested old students are invited to attend the meetings and learn how the center works.</p>
