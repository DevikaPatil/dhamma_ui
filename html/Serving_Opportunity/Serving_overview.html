<h3>Dhamma Service Overview</h3>


<p>
All courses offered at Dhamma Dharā are produced by volunteer labor. Students cook the meals, manage the course, and do everything needed so others may meditate peacefully.
</p>

<p>
Besides service during courses, this large and active meditation center has many other needs that students generously give their time to fulfill.
</p>

<p>
In short, there are always opportunities to serve:</p>

 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;Between Courses (click here to Apply). </li>
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;Spring and Fall Work Periods.</li>
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;Weekend Projects.</li>
  <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;Join a Committee. </li>
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;Come to a Trust Meeting.</li>
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;Become a Long Term Server.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>
Who is qualified for Dhamma Service?</p>


<ul class="list-unstyled">
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;Any student who has successfully completed a 10-day course with S. N. Goenka or one of his assisant teachers, and has not practiced any other meditation techniques since their last course. </li>
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;If another meditation technique has been practiced we ask that you complete another 10-day course before serving. </li>
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;If you have not sat a 10-day course in some time and have not maintained your practice, then we may ask that you sit a 10-day course to strengthen your own practice before serving others.</li>
 <li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty"></span> &nbsp;It is required that all applicants for service read the Code of Conduct for Dhamma Workers prior to filling out a Dhamma Service Application so the guidelines pertaining to serving are understood.</li>
  
</ul>

Whether during courses, between courses or during work periods, servers always sit three group meditations each day, can attend the evening discourse, and usually meet together in the evening with an A.T.  The most common feedback given by servers is their appreciation of how this program helps them integrate the practice of Dhamma into their busy daily lives.
