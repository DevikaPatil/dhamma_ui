   <h2 class="page-title">Dhamma Service Overview</h2>
        
          


<p>All courses offered at Dhamma Delaware are produced by volunteer old students. Students cook the meals, manage the course, and do everything needed so others may meditate peacefully.</p> 

<p>Besides service during courses, this large and active meditation center has many other needs that students generously give their time to fulfill.</p>

<p>In short, there are always opportunities to serve:
<ul class="list-style">
<li>During Courses.</li>
<li>Between Courses</li>
<li>Spring and Fall Work Periods.</li>
<li>Weekend Projects.</li>
<li>Join a Committee.</li>
<li>Come to a Trust Meeting.</li>
<li>Become a Long Term Server.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To give Dhamma service during a course or during the next Dhamma Service Period, 
please visit the Dhamma Pubbananda (Delaware) Course Schedule page. 
Click on the &quot;yes&quot; link under &quot;Servers needed&quot; to apply for a course, or click &quot;Apply&quot; 
then &quot;Serve the course&quot; after indicating that you are an old student.
More information about dhamma service is available on the International Dhamma Service page.
</p>

<p>Who is qualified for Dhamma Service?
<ul class="list-style">
<li>Any student who has successfully completed a 10-day course with S. N. Goenka or one of his assistant teachers, and has not practiced any other meditation techniques since their last course.</li>
<li>If another meditation technique has been practiced we ask that you complete another 10-day course before serving.</li>
<li>If you have not sat a 10-day course in some time and have not maintained your practice, then we may ask that you sit a 10-day course to strengthen your own practice before serving others.</li>
<li>It is required that all applicants for service read the Code of Conduct for Dhamma Workers prior to filling out a Dhamma Service Application so the guidelines pertaining to serving are understood.</li>
</ul>
