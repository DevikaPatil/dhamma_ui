<p>
The center is a special place where those resident do their utmost to preserve the unique meditative atmosphere. It is not a place to come to escape from worldly responsibilities or because one has nowhere else to go. It is a place of renunciation and celibacy where a student of Vipassana has a wonderful opportunity to grow in Dhamma. Dhamma service has enormous benefits for those who give it as well as those who receive. May more and more people share these benefits and come out of their suffering.
</p>

<p>
Long-term servers will follow the regular Code of Conduct for Dhamma servers. They are also expected to observe the following additional points:
</p>

<h3>Sit/Serve Server Guidelines</h3>
<p><b>Five Precepts:</b> Long-term servers must observe the five precepts for the complete duration of their stay, not only while resident on Dhamma property but also during break periods away from the center. During their period of service they should be celibate or in a committed relationship.</p>
<p><b>Daily practice: </b>They must sit the three group sittings daily and attend server’s Metta (when an assistant teacher is present). Lights out at 10pm.</p>
<p><b>Facilities:</b> Servers will stay in server accommodation on the course compound.</p>
<p><b>Meals: </b> Meals are provided at the center.</p>
<p><b>Meeting with assistant teachers: </b> Once a month, all long-term servers will have a face-to-face interview with an AT, to review their practice and integration into service. They are welcome to contact the assistant teacher at any time during their service.</p>
<p><b>Sitting courses:</b> Long-term servers must sit a course at least once every three months. They may be able to sit more if there are enough servers for each course. The purpose of their extended stay at the center is to grow in Dhamma by serving and sitting. </p>
<p><b>Serving courses: </b>While serving on courses long-term servers should put aside their previous daily routines, give full attention to the course and remain on site. Non-urgent personal business should be attended to after the course.</p>
<p><b>Between courses:</b> In addition to serving on courses, there is a great deal of work to be done to keep the center running smoothly. The center management will delegate work, and long-term servers will sometimes be asked to take on more responsibility and supervise the work in certain areas. </p>
<p><b>Time Off: </b>The purpose of staying for an extended time at Dhamma Dhara is to serve. However we understand that some time off is necessary to relax more and to take care of any personal business. Servers may take off one days a week when not serving courses. This will be arranged in advance and in consultation with the center management, who must ensure there are always enough servers on duty at any time. If servers need longer time to visit family or take care of personal business thent his can be arranged with center management.</p>
<p><b>Leisure time:</b> During their days off, long-term servers may stay at the center and rest, or they may leave the center for the day or evening. When going out from the center servers should be mindful that they will be returning directly to Dhamma land, and so any activity they do should be compatible with this. It is inappropriate to visit places that actively encourage people to break sila, such as bars. Avoid going to movies with content of an explicit sexual nature or excessive gratuitous violence.</p>
<p><b>Reading materials:</b> Servers will have full access to the library of Dhamma books. Current affairs newspapers and magazines may be read in the server common rooms only. Other reading material is not appropriate at the center.</p>
<p><b>Segregation of sexes:</b> To protect and preserve the strong Dhamma atmosphere of the center, strict segregation of sexes must be maintained at all times, both during and between courses. There are separate accommodations for men and women as well as separate dining areas. Dhamma servers must be very careful to treat those of the opposite sex as their brothers or sisters. While Dhamma partnerships are not discouraged, the center is not a place to develop them. Therefore, if two servers find themselves attracted to one another and want to pursue a relationship, one or both should not continue in the long-term server program. Meet with an assistant teacher for guidance if this situation arises.</p>
<p><b>Use of Center property:</b> As a Dhamma worker, one lives the life of a renunciate. The center will provide the basic requirements of food and shelter; other expenses are the responsibility of the servers themselves. Dhamma servers should take care not to appropriate center property for their own use without permission.</p>
<p><b>Pets:</b> No pets are allowed on center property.</p>
<p><b>Stipend:</b> This is not a stipended position and no health insurance is provided.
The center reserves the option to ask a student to leave at any time if their long-term service is not meeting the student’s or the center’s needs.</p>

<h3>Off-Site Long-Term Server Guidlines</h3>
<p><b>Five Precepts:</b> Long-term servers must observe the five precepts for the complete duration of their stay, not only while resident on Dhamma property but also during break periods away from the center. During their period of service they should be celibate or in a committed relationship.</p>
<p><b>Daily practice:</b> They must sit two group sittings daily, with one sitting at the center (except on days off).</p>
<p><b>Facilities:</b> Housing off the course compound will be provided to long-tern servers. While these accommodations are not necessarily on center property, they are provided by the center and are therefore considered Dhamma land. Gender segregation should be observed at all times. Common areas will be furnished by VMC, not by servers, unless approved by the management. Long-term servers may furnish their own bedrooms. Twin beds are provided. Servers may watch television, keeping in mind that the content should not be gratuitously violent or sexual in nature. Heat, electricity and basic phone service are paid by the center. Any long distance charges are the responsibility of the server.</p>
<p><b>Meals:</b> Long-term servers can eat at the center while serving and can take some food from the center for days off and dinners at home. Long-term servers may not prepare meat, fish or poultry at the long-term servers’ quarters; eggs are okay.</p>
<p><b>Meeting with assistant teachers:</b> Once a month, long-term servers will have a face-to-face interview with an AT, to review their practice and integration into service. They are welcome to contact the assistant teacher at any time during their service.</p>
<p><b>Sitting courses: </b>Long-term servers must sit a course at least once every three or four months. They may be able to sit more if there are enough servers for each course and coverage for any jobs they are assigned. However, they should understand that their main focus is service.</p>
<p><b>Serving courses:</b> While serving on courses long-term servers should put aside their previous daily routines, give full attention to the course and remain on site. Non-urgent personal business should be attended to after the course.</p>
<p><b>Between courses:</b> In addition to serving on courses, there is a great deal of work to be done to keep the center running smoothly. The center management will delegate work, and long-term servers will sometimes be asked to take on more responsibility and supervise the work in certain areas. Long-term servers are invited and encouraged to join one of the committees that manage the center.</p>
<p><b>Time Off: </b> Long-term servers should schedule regular time off, normally two days a week when not serving courses. This will be arranged in advance and in consultation with the center management, who ensure there are always enough servers on duty at any time.</p>
<p><b>Leisure time:</b> When going out from the center servers should be mindful that they will be returning directly to Dhamma land, and so any activity they do should be compatible with this. It is inappropriate to visit places that actively encourage people to break sila, such as bars. Avoid going to movies with content of an explicit sexual nature or excessive gratuitous violence.

<p><b>Guests:</b> No overnight guests unless cleared with staff committee advisors.</p>
<p><b>Stipend:</b> This is not a stipended position and no health insurance is provided.</p>
