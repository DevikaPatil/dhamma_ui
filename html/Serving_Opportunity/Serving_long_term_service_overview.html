   <h2>Long-Term Service Overview</h2>

<p>
Giving Dhamma service is one of the most valuable experiences a student of Vipassana can have. Not only is it rewarding to know that you have helped others to taste the nectar of Dhamma, but it also is a wonderful source of growth and strength for your own meditation practice.
</p>

<p>
Long-term Dhamma service is for those who wish to develop their paramis by serving for longer periods of time. It gives students the opportunity to bring depth and maturity to their meditation practice by integrating what they have learned during courses and applying it while serving. Students will learn to serve properly with an attitude of humility and renunciation. Long-term service is intended for students who are able to work hard in a surrendered and co-operative way, and who are eager to learn how best to serve in this unique Dhamma environment. This extended period of service provides a great opportunity to deepen one’s practice as well as helping the center to run smoothly.
</p>

<p>
As a long-term server, you will begin your stay by being involved directly with serving courses, either as a kitchen worker or course manager. As you become more familiar with the center you may be asked to take on more responsibility by getting involved with the committee structure and general operations of the center.
</p>

<p>
<b>There are two Long Term Service programs at VMC:</b>
</p>

<p>
Our Sit-Serve program allows students to be in residence for a number of months, participating in courses as a student and as a server, with a greater emphasis on serving. Students may serve two courses, then sit one course and then serve again, depending on the length and type of courses and how well each long-term server is integrating their experience. Assistant Teachers will be available to discuss servers’ development in Dhamma and the integration of their practice. To qualify for this program, a student must first sit and then serve a course at Dhamma Dharā.
</p>

<p>
Our Off-Site Long Term Service program is for students who can commit to 6 months or longer of service to the center. Here students are allowed to live in our long-term servers’ residences outside the course compound. Long-term servers may serve courses as well as take part in different jobs like course management support, registration, maintenance, grounds & garden, household, and contacting volunteers to serve directly on our courses. Meals are provided at the center and segregated lodging is provided on adjacent properties nearby. Assistant Teachers will be available to discuss server’ development in Dhamma and the integration of their practice.
</p>

<p>
Sincere old students who are practicing this technique exclusively and maintaining the five precepts in their daily life are eligible for Off-site Long-term service at Dhamma Dharā. An additional requirement is completion of the Sit-Serve residential program at VMC.
</p>

<p>
Many questions that you may have pertaining to Long-term Service can be answered by reading the Long Term Dhamma Service FAQ.
 Any old student may apply. Please understand that acceptance is contingent upon approval of an assistant teacher and center management. The center reserves the option to ask a student to leave at any time if their long term service is not meeting the student’s or center’s needs. If interested, please 8217;s needs. If interested, please <a href="http://www.dhara.dhamma.org/filebase/applications/LTS-Application.pdf" >download an application</a> (PDF), and submit it by mail or fax to the center.
</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><b>Who is eligible to give Long Term Service?</b></p>

<p>
Any old student who has both sat and served a course at Dhamma Dhara may apply to give long-term service. It is important for students who apply for long-term Service to understand that staying at the center for an extended period of time is to serve others and at the same time strengthen their own practice. It should not be simply because they have no other place to go or as a place to stay while conducting their personal affairs.
</p>

<p><b>
How long can an old student stay at the center?
</b></p>

<p>
An old student could stay at the center for up to a year or longer. The length of time is determined by an initial interview between the student and an assistant teacher and/or the center manager as well as monthly AT interviews during their stay. Since there is no actual contract between the student and the center, the student or the management may shorten or lengthen their stay at any time.
</p>

<p>
An Off-Site Long-term server is required to make a commitment of at least 6 months, living off site and devoting most of their time to the center. These long-term servers are especially important on day 0, Metta days and day 11s. They should also expect to be available to the center on some weekends and holidays.
</p>

<p><b>
What is the course and daily sitting schedule for a Long Term Server?
</b></p>

<p>
As part of their stay at the center, long-term servers are encouraged to sit a course periodically. However, the main focus is to serve the center. Sit-Servers in residence at VMC are expected to sit the three daily group sittings and may sit more during their free time. They will usually serve two to three courses, then sit one, and then serve again, thus sitting a course every month and a half to two months. Off-site long-term servers are expected to sit a minimum of two hours daily, with one of their sittings at the center on work days. They sit a course every three or four months. Schedules for both types of servers are determined in discussion with center management and staff committee.
</p>

<p><b>
Do Long Term Servers follow the same guidelines as a regular course server?
</b></p>

<p>
Anyone who is serving at the center must follow the guidelines as stated in the Code of Conduct for Dhamma Workers. It is especially important for long-term servers to understand and follow these guidelines because they will have more responsibility and therefore be an example to other servers. Maintaining sila, as outlined in the Code of Conduct, is of utmost importance.
</p>

<p><b>
Do Long Term Servers get time off from the center?
</b></p>

<p>
We realize that it is important for someone staying longer at the center to have some down time and days off to tend to personal business and simply relax off the center grounds. If one is involved directly with serving on courses, then days off are scheduled between courses. If the long-term server is a member of a committee and not involved directly as a course server, then time off can be more flexible, depending on his/her responsibilities. Off-Site long-term servers will discuss time off with the staff committee.
</p>

<p><b>
What are the accommodations for a Long Term Server?
</b></p>

<p>
Those participating in the Sit/Serve program are accommodated in the servers’ accommodation at the center. Those in the Off-Site program are given more private accommodation located on adjacent properties close by (a 3 – 4 bedroom house and a separately located 2 bedroom apartment both including a kitchen, 2 bathrooms, garden space and nearby stream).
