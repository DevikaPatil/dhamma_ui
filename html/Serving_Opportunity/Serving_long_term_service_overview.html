    <h2 class="page-title">Long-Term Service Overview</h2>

<p>
Giving Dhamma service is one of the most valuable experiences a student of Vipassana can have. Not only is it rewarding to know that you have helped others to taste the nectar of Dhamma, but it also is a wonderful source of growth and strength for your own meditation practice.</p>

<p>
Long-term Dhamma service is for those who wish to develop their paramis by serving for longer periods of time. It gives students the opportunity to bring depth and maturity to their meditation practice by integrating what they have learned during courses and applying it while serving. Students will learn to serve properly with an attitude of humility and renunciation. Long-term service is intended for students who are able to work hard in a surrendered and co-operative way, and who are eager to learn how best to serve in this unique Dhamma environment. This extended period of service provides a great opportunity to deepen one’s practice as well as helping the center to run smoothly.
</p>

<p>
As a long-term server, you will begin your stay by being involved directly with serving courses, either as a kitchen worker or course manager. As you become more familiar with the center you may be asked to take on more responsibility by getting involved with the committee structure and general operations of the center.
</p>

<p><b>There are two Long Term Service programs at Dhamma Pubbananda (Delaware):</b></p>

<ul>
<li>
Our <b>Sit-Serve</b> program allows students to be in residence for a number of months, participating in courses as a student and as a server, with a greater emphasis on serving. Students may serve two courses, then sit one course and then serve again, depending on the length and type of courses and how well each long-term server is integrating their experience. Assistant Teachers will be available to discuss servers’ development in Dhamma and the integration of their practice. To qualify for this program, a student must first sit and then serve a course at Dhamma Pubbananda (Delaware).
</li>

<li>
Our <b>Off-Site Long Term Service</b> program is for students who can commit to 6 months or longer of service to the center. Here students are allowed to live in our long-term servers’ residences outside the course compound. Long-term servers may serve courses as well as take part in different jobs like course management support, registration, maintenance, grounds & garden, household, and contacting volunteers to serve directly on our courses. Meals are provided at the center and segregated lodging is provided on adjacent properties nearby. Assistant Teachers will be available to discuss server’ development in Dhamma and the integration of their practice.
</li>

<p>Sincere old students who are practicing this technique exclusively and maintaining the five precepts in their daily life are eligible for Off-site Long-term service at Dhamma Pubbananda (Delaware). An additional requirement is completion of the Sit-Serve residential program at Dhamma Pubbananda (Delaware).</p>
<p>Many questions that you may have pertaining to Long-term Service can be answered by reading the Long Term Dhamma Service FAQ. Any old student may apply. Please understand that acceptance is contingent upon approval of an assistant teacher and center management. The center reserves the option to ask a student to leave at any time if their long term service is not meeting the student’s or center’s needs. If interested, please write to manager@delaware.dhamma.org</p>
