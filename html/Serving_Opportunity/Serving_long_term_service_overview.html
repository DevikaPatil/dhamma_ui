    <h2 class="page-title">Long-Term Service Overview</h2>

<p>
Giving Dhamma service is one of the most valuable experiences a student of Vipassana can have. Not only is it rewarding to know that you have helped others to taste the nectar of Dhamma, but it also is a wonderful source of growth and strength for your own meditation practice.
</p>

<p>
Long-term Dhamma service is for those who wish to develop their paramis by serving for longer periods of time. It gives students the opportunity to bring depth and maturity to their meditation practice by integrating what they have learned during courses and applying it while serving. Students will learn to serve properly with an attitude of humility and renunciation. Long-term service is intended for students who are able to work hard in a surrendered and co-operative way, and who are eager to learn how best to serve in this unique Dhamma environment. This extended period of service provides a great opportunity to deepen one’s practice as well as helping the center to run smoothly.
</p>

<p>
As a long-term server, you will begin your stay by being involved directly with serving courses, either as a kitchen worker or course manager. As you become more familiar with the center you may be asked to take on more responsibility by getting involved with the committee structure and general operations of the center.
